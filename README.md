# Surface

## Design 
As the salon itself exudes calm and relaxation, I created the page in such a tone. The main background is white because it indicates a sterile, clean and bright space. Background colors I used are bright and soothing, and the images are bright and colorful. The goal was to bring the user closer to the atmosphere of the salon.

## Chosens Color 

- **#3a3a3a the main color** - I chose this color from the lesson "Love Running". I really liked how the text color looked on the page and I used it too
- **#2a2a2a for all h2 headings and nav bar** - color from "Love Running" lesson, I liked how it looks on text. It's neiyher too dark nor too bright
- **rgba(237, 243, 210, 0.6)** - background for Address and Opening Hours. 
It blends perfectly with the look of the whole page and the background image. I wanted the color to match both the image of the head, in which yellow predominates, as well as the background image.
- **rgb(157 157 45 / 43%)** - background for Address and Opening Hours, for media query (max-width 550px) - the background image disappears below 550px, so the background color itself is too pale without the image. I changed the color which gives a nice look to the other half of the pages, and fits nicely with the hero image
- **rgba(79, 79, 82, 0.6)** - for the Footer background. I liked the color because it is neither too dark nor too bright. It does not spoil the look of the page. Since the footer will be on every page, I wanted to choose a color that blends nicely with all the colors
- **rgba(154, 175, 185, 0.7)** - for the "Price List" background color. Blends nicely with the background image. The color is not intrusive, it is soothing like the whole page
- **rgba(79, 79, 82)** - for the Submit button. Fits nicely with the footer. Color is not too pale or too dark yet it's noticeable
 

## Font 

- Open Sans, sans-serif - main font
- Lato - for all h2 and h3 headings


## Media

**Hero image** - is designed in bright and strong colors to grab the user's attention and elevate the overall look of the page

**Contact section** - contains a background image that is soothing and mild. Not conspicuous, and yet does not make the page monotonous

**Services & Prices** - contains a background image that is mild and relaxing

**Our Team** - contains an image just below the header. The photo shows a beautician doing a manicure for a customer. I chose this image because it shows a beautician in her work environment and blends nicely with the whole look of the page.

**Gallery** - contains nail design images so that the user can find the desired design if he needs inspiration. The gallery also helps promote the salon

**Contact Us** - contains images just below the header. Images are placed horizontally. After 950 px they no longer appear on the page.

## Bugs and Issues

- I tested a page on my phone, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, with a black theme. When I open the page, I don’t see hamburger menu. The rest of the text of the page changes color to white, but the hamburger menu does not change its dark color and is therefore not noticeable, but it is still functional.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/images/readme/hamburger-menu.jpg" width="300" height="100%">
</p>

- Design improvment- On the page "Services & Prices" I would like to improve the price list design. When the screen reaches a certen size ( Mobile view), the prices of the treatments should be closer to bottom border. 
I hope to solve this problem in the future.

- For the Gallery Lighthouse report, I noticed that the report varies if I re-report the page. Lighthouse would jump from 85 to 93.

### **HTML Validator** 

- *Warning* : Element “p” not allowed as child of element “h1” in this context
 
warning was fixed by removing th "p" element as a child of "h1" element. I created a "ul" and nested "h1" element and "p" element inside the "li" element. 


 - *Warning* : Element “br” not allowed as child of element “ul” in this context.

warnign was fixed by removing the "br" as a child of "ul" element. 



### **CSS Validator** 

- *Value Error* : font-weight 600px is not a font-weight value : 600px

Error was fixed by removing the incorrect font-sweight

- *Warning* :  Inner is not a color value : inner 0 0 4px rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.2)

warning was fixed by removing the incorrect color value

- *Warning* : Family names containing whitespace should be quoted. If quoting is omitted, any whitespace characters before and after the name are ignored and any sequence of whitespace characters inside the name is converted to a single space.

warning was fixed by removing the white space between the family names.

- *Warning* : -webkit-transition is a vendor extension

warning was fixed by removing the incorrect CSS rule

- *Warning* -moz-border-radius is a vendor extension
     warning was fixed by removing the incorrect CSS rule
